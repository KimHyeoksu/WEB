  <h2> CSS </h2>

<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
  [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
  CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
  This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
